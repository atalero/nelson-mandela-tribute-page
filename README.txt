 Free Code Camp Front-End Project
 
First project in Free Code Camp. I used Bootstrap to make my page and its components responsive. This page can be comfortably viewed on any device. In this tribute to Nelson Mandela, I carefully selected colors to match those of the South African Flag. Images resize according to screen size and the information panels at the bottom stack when the screen width is under 720px (symbolized as md in Bootstrap). The page also links to an external resource on Mandela.
